# Augmented History

Our team "Fire bois" had created this AR app using Unity while participating in the "Hacklipse" event organized by ACM Thapar.
Augmented reality is an app which is meant to improve the views and the approach with which students study or take up history. It will help to generate curiosity and genuine interests of the young minds towards the subject. Hence, greatly improving and enhancing our education system.

## Problem it solves
History is believed to be a boring and tedious subject. There are many young children and even adults who believe that history is not as important or interesting as Science.We have tackled this issue by creating a platform in which history can be transformed into something very life like and interesting.For this time,we have decided to build a module on the Harrapan Civilization. With the help of Augmented Reality we have tried to recreate the scenery and the atmosphere of the Indus-Valley towns like Harrapa and Mohenjodaro. We have also made 3d models of the famous artifacts and the statues from the Harrapan Civilization.
## Tech Stack

**Unity,** **Vuforia,** **C#**



## Difficulties faced while making the project
As fas as challenges are concerned, the most tricky one has to be the wifi.We had originally planned to build the project on Unreal Engine but the slow wifi and the 21.2gb from unreal scared us away.Fortunately, one of us already had Unity installed.Hence ,we decided to proceed with Unity.The second challenge was our code itself,We had faced a lot of errors in our code and debugging it was definetely not easy.I'd have to say that compared to other challenges debugging did take quite a lot of our time.
